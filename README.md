This flyer _EMPHASIS_ to  people that there is a restaurant/food service nearby, and that they also make delicious foods.
The _HIERARCHY_  is also just right.
The _COLOR_ is just right for me,i mean am already feeling quit hungry now.
Lastly everything on this flyer is just _complementary_ to each other.

From just looking at this poster, we immediately know what it it without even reading it yet.
Also from just looking on how the background seems to be in a dry desert, I think it goes to show us what to expect.

This flyer _EMPHASIS_ to  people that there is a restaurant/food service nearby, and that they also make delicious foods.
The _HIERARCHY_  is also just right.
The _COLOR_ is just right for me,i mean am already feeling quit hungry now. _hint_ the red color if not at least tries to make people hungry.
Lastly everything on this flyer is just _complementary_ to each other.

Looking at this Ad without even reading it yet, we are able to come to the conclusion that they are foreign locations.
And it's not just any location they are eye catching, and also have the potential of pranting the seed for anyone who can afford such travles to consider the angcy.

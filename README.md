This flyer _EMPHASIS_ to  people that there is a restaurant/food service nearby, and that they also make delicious foods.
The _HIERARCHY_  is also just right.
The _COLOR_ is just right for me,i mean am already feeling quit hungry now.
Lastly everything on this flyer is just _complementary_ to each other.
